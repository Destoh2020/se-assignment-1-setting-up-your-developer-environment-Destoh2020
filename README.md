# Dev_Setup

Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
   Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
   Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process.

#Deliverables:

- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- To set up a developer environment there are a number of things to consider and the specific tools may vary depending on the chosen programming language and project requirements.
  1.  Choose an operating system.
      I installed windows 11 as my operating system. To install windows 11 first head over to the https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11 and download windows 11 for 64bit sytem. I downloaded Rufus which is a software that I used to make my 8GB flash drive bootable. Once the flash is bootable plug it to the usb port and restart the pc before the pc boots interrupt the normal start up by pressing the esc key or F12 for a lenovo laptop. Choose the machine to boot from the flash drive follow. once in the it load click on install windows. in the next screen it will ask you to input the product key input the key if you have or click on i dont have product key and click next choose on custom to enbale you cutomize and format the drive where you will install the operating system. click on next and wait for the install to finish and follow tha instruction to complete setup.
  2.  Install code editor.
      I downloaded visual studio code from the official website https://code.visualstudio.com/Download. Once the download is finished double click on the setup.exe to run the installer click next > next >next... > finish. After install launch the VsCode and head over to the extension and install the necessary extensions required for theme, formatting, linting etc.
      I also installed Pycharm to install pycharm first create an account with jetbrains with a student account if you have one to download the professional IDE. If you have no student email download the community edition which is free and install it.
  3.  Install Version Control System.
      I installed Git as The version control system. browse to the official website of git. https://www.git-scm.com/ and download the setup. Double click on the installer to run it the installation will begin click the next button to the end and finally the finish button. Git i installed. Git will enable for collaboration with others and revert to previous versions if needed.
  4.  Installed Language Specific tools.
      Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and package manager pip for installing libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas for data science).
  5.  Configuration and Customization.
      I configured and customized vscode for easy and best preferences. In the extensions marketplace i installed prettier for code formating, ESLint for bug detection, theme, i downloaded the github theme and changed the color theme to dark.
      I also customized my terminal's appearence, font, color and behaviour.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).

  - https://github.com/Destoh2020/plpsampleproject.git

- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.
  The challenges faced during setup and the strategies I enployed are;
  1.  Choosing the right tool - I researched by reading reviews, explored online tutorials and watched developer workflow videos.
  2.  Configuration and Customization - I started wit default settings initially and gradually cutomized them as i got comfortable
  3.  Troubleshooting Errors - I read errors message carefully about the source of the issue. I also used online resource and site like stack overflow and other communities for troubleshootings steps.
  4.  Keeping Up-to-Date - maintaining an up-to date development environment.
  5.  I also enable updates for operating systems.
